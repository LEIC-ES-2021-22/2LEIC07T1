# Product vision

For students who want to study in FEUP (or surroundings) the **Uniteca** is a mobile application designed to help students determine where to study. It presents information like the library's occupation and traffic so people can organize their studying schedule.
In other sources, like SIGARRA and the library's website, the information is scattered along the web. Our product displays everything the user needs in an easy access way so it can be used with most efficiency.
