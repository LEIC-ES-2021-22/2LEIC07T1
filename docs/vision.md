# Product vision

For students who want to study in FEUP (or surroundings), **Uniteca** is a mobile application designed to help students determine where to study. It presents information like the library's occupation and traffic so people can organize their studying schedule.
In other sources, like SIGARRA and the library's website, the information is scattered and not easy to access. Our product displays relevant information in a friendly environment, as well as additional information like the usual traffic on the library.
