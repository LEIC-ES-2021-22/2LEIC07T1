# Iteration 1

Check the release of this iteration [here](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/2LEIC07T1/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

## Retrospective

### What went well?

 - The work distribution was better organized on this iteration. Because of that, we were able to finish all the work that was planned.
 - Looking back at the first iteration, we made a lot of improvements communication wise, which made the development process more efficient.
 - Unlike the first iteration, we spent more time developing unit test.
 - Continued to follow good Git and GitHub practices. 

### What should we do differently?

 - Due to version incompatibility, we could no implement integration tests. This should be worked on next.
 - We should pay more attention to the work distribution over time, so we don't end up overloaded near the deadline. 

### What still puzzles me?

 - We were not able to implement acceptance tests due to technical reasons.
 - There are some aspects of the Dart language and Flutter that we are not familiar yet. The same goes for the Uni codebase.
