# Iteration 3

Check the release of this iteration [here](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/2LEIC07T1/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

## Retrospective

### What went well?

 - Looking back at the first iteration, the use and knowledge of the required technologies improved significantly.
 - We were able to achieve almost everything we had set up to do at the beginning of the project.
 - Continued to follow good Git and GitHub practices. 

### What should we do differently?

 - Due to version incompatibility, we could no implement integration tests. 
 - We should pay more attention to the work distribution over time, so we don't end up overloaded near the deadline. 

### What still puzzles me?

 - We were not able to implement acceptance tests due to technical reasons.
